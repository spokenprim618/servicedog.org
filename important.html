    <h2>Why Emotional Service Animals Are Important </h2>
    <p>Emotional service dogs may sound un-important at first, but roughly 18% of Americans live with a emotional/mental disability, that can benifit from a 
        Emotional Service Animal(ESA). Mental health professionals perscribe ESAs to many people living with disablilities and illnesses. They can help with a wide array of illnesses like depression, anxiety, and PTSD. But they can also help people of all ages living with ADHD and autism. You may also ask how these animals help with such things. Well first off, they provide unconditional love and attention to their owners. They can also give owners a feeling of purpose  and responsibility, Taking care of an animal can provide a great deal of self worth that can be invaluable to get motivated and be productive when they need it. They can also provide comfort when you need it. For example, if you are anxious about getting on a flight, an ESA can provide comfort when needed. In conclusion, ESAs can make best friends to the people who need it, almost being like a furry side kick, or a sholder to cry on.</p>
