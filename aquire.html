        If you adopt a dog you are saving it's life because in 5 to 7 days the will be euthanized.
        Any adopted dog would have their health examined, any vaccines they are missing, some may be sterilized depending on age, groomed, their behavior will be tested if they are safe to be adopted. 
        You must make sure to get any medical documentation from the shelter.

        The dog might not be fertile due to it being spayed or neutered unless specifically asked for it not to be. 
        Adoption fees $25-$500 can be higher if it's a younger dog and you can have no adoption fees if it's a senior dog, regestration is $29, insurance depends on policy, dog breed, and age
