        You must make sure a dog breeder has the correct papers to be allowed to sell dogs. From a breeder you will pay $3500, medical cost $1,000 for the first year then $500 after, dog items about $500, dog school(optional) $250, registration fees $58 for non-fertile and $210 for a fertile dog, pet insurance $840 a year and can be higher or lower depending on the breed. Some pet stores have injured or sick dogs which will be costly depending on the injury or sickness. If you buy a puppy you will have to pay for its vaccination and physical examinations. Buying a dog is simple all you need to do is pay and the dog is yours.
